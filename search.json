So when I came across dossier, I got pretty excited.  I was also a little skeptical, since the price seemed too good.  I didn’t really think it would smell just like Coco, but whoa was I wrong. This stuff is seriously amazing.","I ordered Oriental Woody 1. I paid about $25 for it (since my sister and I each bought one, we got a better deal).  Here’s what I found great and not so great about it.\n\npros\n• cruelty free\n• smells exactly like the perfume it’s inspired by\n• nice packaging\n• comes with a sample to try first\n• insanely good price\n• scent lasts all day\n\ncons\n• the only con I can think of is the packaging sticker on the bottle is slightly wrinkled","Dossier does a cool deal where you get up to 25% off your order, depending on how many you buy.  I think their best deal is you can get 5\/$109.  I definitely recommend.  I’ll probably go stock up on some more of my other fav luxury scents!","It comes packaged in this cute little box.","I love that it comes with a sample that you can try first to make sure you like it.  I always feel bad returning things after I’ve tried them, so this way I don’t have to even try the large bottle. Woo!","curiosa 2020"]},{"title":"beauty","link":"beauty.html","texts":["beauty","beauty","dossier: an alternative to your fav perfumes","07.23.2020","the latest posts","curiosa 2020","beauty","face peels: drunk elephant vs. the ordinary","07.26.2020"]},{"title":"peels","link":"peels.html","texts":["face peels:  drunk elephant vs. the ordinary","curiosa 2020","Which is really better - Drunk Elephant’s Sukari Babyfacial or The Ordinary’s AHA + BHA?\n","First, a look at the key ingredients:","The Ordinary AHA + BHA\n• glycolic acid\n• salicylic acid\n• lactic acid\n• tartaric acid\n• citric acid\n• extracts: caucus carota sativa, tasmannia lanceolata fruit\/leaf\n• aloe leaf water","Drunk Elephant Sukari Babyfacial\n• glycolic acid\n• salicylic acid\n• lactic acid\n• citric acid\n• extracts: aloe leaf, camellia oleifera leaf, pumpkin ferment, tunica granatum fruit ferment, opuntia ficus-indica, apple, silybum marianum seed, saccharomyces cerevisiae, grape juice","Drunk Elephant Sukari Babyfacial is also packed with various oils and seed\/leaf powders.\n\nOverall, the ingredient list between the two is similar when it comes to the acids. The Ordinary has an additional acid though, tartaric acid, which naturally occurs in grapes - it aids in helping lactic and glycolic acid’s ability to slough the skin.\n\nThere is also a higher percent of AHA (glycolic\/lactic acids) in The Ordinary AHA + BHA - 30% (vs. 25% in Drunk Elephant).","The cost?","Drunk Elephant Sukari Babyfacial\n• $47.34\/1 oz (this product only sells in a 1.69 oz bottle for $80, but for comparison I converted the price if it sold at 1 oz) ","The Ordinary AHA + BHA\n• $7.20\/1 oz","My review?\n\nBoth products give the same feeling when applied - the intense burning\/tingling feeling. The textures are very different, though, with The Ordinary being smoother\/less viscous and Drunk Elephant being thicker\/stickier.\n\nThe feeling of my skin after use is similar between the products - very clean! But Drunk Elephant makes my skin feel a bit softer than The Ordinary, probably due to the extra oils and extracts it contains. Though, it’s not worth the extra $40 for slightly softer skin. There’s nothing a moisturizer can’t fix!\n\nI love both of these products, but I’d say The Ordinary AHA + BHA is the winner of these two - you can’t beat the quality and price!"]}]
