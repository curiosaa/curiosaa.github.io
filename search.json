So when I came across dossier, I got pretty excited.  I was also a little skeptical, since the price seemed too good.  I didn’t really think it would smell just like Coco, but whoa was I wrong. This stuff is seriously amazing.","I ordered Oriental Woody 1. I paid about $25 for it (since my sister and I each bought one, we got a better deal).  Here’s what I found great and not so great about it.\n\npros\n• cruelty free\n• smells exactly like the perfume it’s inspired by\n• nice packaging\n• comes with a sample to try first\n• insanely good price\n• scent lasts all day\n\ncons\n• the only con I can think of is the packaging sticker on the bottle is slightly wrinkled","Dossier does a cool deal where you get up to 25% off your order, depending on how many you buy.  I think their best deal is you can get 5\/$109.  I definitely recommend.  I’ll probably go stock up on some more of my other fav luxury scents!","It comes packaged in this cute little box.","I love that it comes with a sample that you can try first to make sure you like it.  I always feel bad returning things after I’ve tried them, so this way I don’t have to even try the large bottle. Woo!","curiosa 2020"]},{"title":"beauty","link":"beauty.html","texts":["beauty","beauty","dossier: an alternative to your fav perfumes","07.23.2020","the latest posts","curiosa 2020"]}]
